This repo is dedicated to learning about and comprehending smart contracts.
It is going to serve as a guide and portfolio highlighting my progress in learning and utilizing Solidity to create smart contracts.

Smart Contracts:
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. 
They run on blockchain technology, providing security, transparency, and automation in various applications.
